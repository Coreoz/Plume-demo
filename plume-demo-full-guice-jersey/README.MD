A demo application of the whole Plume ecosystem
===============================================

**While usable, this demo is not finished yet, the administration part misses the UI interface**

Running the application
-----------------------
Just launch the `org.plume.demo.WebApplication` class and open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.

If it is not already the case, you will also have to configure your IDE to support Lombok:
<https://projectlombok.org/download.html>

Swagger documentation
---------------------
It is available through the URL: http://localhost:8080/webjars/swagger-ui/2.1.5/index.html?url=/api/swagger
Then the browser should prompt for credentials:
- login: plume
- password: rocks
